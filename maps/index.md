to the Groundwater Nitrates study.  They are organized by technical
report, and carry the same figure numbers.

 Fig12 Simulated land application of dairy manure N exported from dairies and land applied within the county of origin at rates proportional and in addition to typical N fertilizer needs in each crop (see Figure 4). Total manure exports represent 38% of animal N excreted (“Scenario C (by County)”). |

 Figure 13. Simulated land application of dairy manure N exported from dairies and land applied across the study area (not restricted to the county of origin) at rates proportional and in addition to typical N fertilizer needs in each crop (see Figure 4).

 Figure 14. Simulated nitrogen harvested in 2005 from all cropland including alfalfa. The simulation assumes 1.7 annual crops in seven vegetable crops (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, lettuce, spinach) and double-cropping of all corn acreage with winter grain. Units [kg N\ha\yr]|

 Figure 15. Simulated groundwater nitrate loading from all sources including cropland. Simulation of the hypothetical “Scenario D”: All land applied manure N (62% of animal N excreted) is applied to corn, grain, and other field crops (not including alfalfa) under the direct management of dairies (no manure N exports). |
